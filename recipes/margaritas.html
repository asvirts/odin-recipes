        <h2>Description:</h2>
            <h3>This is a cocktail riff on a lemonade recipe we love (armagazine.com/rosemary-infused-watermelon-lemonade). The herb-melon combo is delicious, and watermelon's natural sweetness keeps added sugar low.</h3>
                <p>Margaritas are what you pour for life’s happiest moments, as evidenced by 3.4 million #margarita tags on Instagram, that song, and the fact that Matthew McConaughey, perhaps the only man who makes Will Smith look grumpy,
                    has his own recipe (it’s alright, alright, alright). This simple concoction of tequila, lime, agave and orange liqueur has stolen our hearts.  Whether you like yours frozen, on the rocks, salt, or no salt, sweet or spicy,
                    the margarita is a big, inclusive tent -- with a giant umbrella sticking out of it. So we wrote this love letter to its sheer perfection.</p>
                <p>The margarita looks and feels oh-so-right whether you’re in a tuxedo or a bathing suit, sipping from a dainty glass or slurping from a giant plastic cup. Wherever your margarita typically falls on the drink’s cultural and economic spectrum,
                    consider the following: Manhattan’s London hotel mixed the most expensive margarita, at $1200 a glass, this year. The outrageously expensive secret ingredient was a limited-edition Patron, of which only 500 bottles were made.
                    And back in sippy cup territory, the margarita was the natural choice for the world’s largest cocktail -- 10,499 gallons to be precise -- concocted in a 25-foot tall blender at the 2012 California state fair and sold at $10 a pop.</p>
            <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>1 cup water</li>
                        <li>⅓ cup white sugar</li>
                        <li>1½ teaspoons chopped fresh rosemary</li>
                        <li>6 cups cubed seeded watermelon</li>
                        <li>1 cup lemon juice</li>
                        <li>1 tablespoon kosher salt</li>
                        <li>1 tablespoon white sugar</li>
                        <li>8 fluid ounces reposado tequila</li>
                        <li>rosemary sprigs for serving</li>
                        <li>watermelon wedges for serving</li>
                    </ul>
            <h3>Steps:</h3>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Bring 1 cup water and 1/3 cup sugar to a boil in a small saucepan, stirring occasionally to dissolve sugar. Stir in chopped rosemary. Let steep for1 hour.</li>
                        <li>Strain rosemary syrup into a blender. Add watermelon and lemon juice. Purée until smooth, about 30 seconds. Strain lemonade mixture, then freeze in ice cube trays until solid, 8 hours or overnight.</li>
                        <li>Mix together salt and remaining 1 tablespoon sugar in a small shallow dish. Lightly dampen rims of 4 (12-ounce) glasses with a wet paper towel. Roll glass rims in salt-sugar mixture until coated.</li>
                        <li>Working in batches, blend half of the frozen watermelon-lemonade cubes and 4 ounces tequila in a blender or food processor until slushy, adding 1 to 2 tablespoons of water as needed to help blend mixture. Pour into prepared glasses. Repeat with remaining watermelon-lemonade cubes and remaining tequila. Garnish with rosemary sprigs and watermelon wedges.</li>
                    </ol>
