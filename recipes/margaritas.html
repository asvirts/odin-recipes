        <h2>Description:</h2>
            <h3>This is a cocktail riff on a lemonade recipe we love (armagazine.com/rosemary-infused-watermelon-lemonade). The herb-melon combo is delicious, and watermelon's natural sweetness keeps added sugar low.</h3>
                <p>Margaritas are what you pour for life’s happiest moments, as evidenced by 3.4 million #margarita tags on Instagram, that song, and the fact that Matthew McConaughey, perhaps the only man who makes Will Smith look grumpy,
                    has his own recipe (it’s alright, alright, alright). This simple concoction of tequila, lime, agave and orange liqueur has stolen our hearts.  Whether you like yours frozen, on the rocks, salt, or no salt, sweet or spicy,
                    the margarita is a big, inclusive tent -- with a giant umbrella sticking out of it. So we wrote this love letter to its sheer perfection.</p>
                <p>The margarita looks and feels oh-so-right whether you’re in a tuxedo or a bathing suit, sipping from a dainty glass or slurping from a giant plastic cup. Wherever your margarita typically falls on the drink’s cultural and economic spectrum,
                    consider the following: Manhattan’s London hotel mixed the most expensive margarita, at $1200 a glass, this year. The outrageously expensive secret ingredient was a limited-edition Patron, of which only 500 bottles were made.
                    And back in sippy cup territory, the margarita was the natural choice for the world’s largest cocktail -- 10,499 gallons to be precise -- concocted in a 25-foot tall blender at the 2012 California state fair and sold at $10 a pop.</p>
